        <p><strong>Meet Themba Dube</strong>, a driver from Vosloorus, whose life changed after verifying his documents with Verify.</p>

        <p>For months, Themba applied for driver positions at logistics companies across Gauteng, but never heard back. Employers kept asking for proof of his PDP license and police clearance certificate, which he didn’t have ready.</p>

        <p><em>“I was stuck,”</em> Themba recalls. “Even when I got an interview, they wanted documents I couldn’t provide.”</p>

        <p>That changed when Themba heard about Verify from a friend who found a job as a delivery driver. He signed up for the <span class="text-primary font-bold">Silver package</span>, which included CV verification and police clearance. “The process was easy,” he says. “I uploaded my ID and license, and Verify helped me apply for police clearance.”</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🔍 The Power of Verification</h2>

        <p>Within two weeks, Themba’s profile was marked as “Silver Verified” on the Verify platform. His verified PDP license and clean criminal record were immediately visible to employers.</p>

        <p>Three days later, a logistics company contacted him. The HR manager explained that they chose him because he already had verified documents: “We don’t want to spend weeks checking references. With verified candidates, we can hire much faster.”</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">✅ Landing the Job</h2>

        <p>Themba focused on his experience and skills, not paperwork delays. A week later, he started as a delivery driver with a stable salary, benefits, and predictable hours. He’s now saving to upgrade to Verify’s Gold package.</p>

        <div class="quote">“Getting verified changed everything. I went from months of silence to being hired within days.”</div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🚦 Why Employers Love Verified Drivers</h2>

        <p>Verified driver profiles are <strong>60% more likely</strong> to get interviews and <strong>75% more likely</strong> to receive job offers for PDP-required positions. Employers save time and reduce hiring risks with pre-verified candidates.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">🚀 Take the Next Step</h2>

        <p>Don’t let missing paperwork hold you back. <a href="register.html" class="text-primary font-medium hover:underline">Get verified today</a> and start getting calls from employers who trust your credentials.</p>
